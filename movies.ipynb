    "#Movie Recommendation System\n",
    "#Introduction\n",
    "#This project is a simple Python-based Movie Recommendation System. It asks the user to select a preferred movie genre and then suggests movies from that genre. It uses fundamental Python concepts like lists and conditional statements (if-else-elif).\n",
    "#Requirements\n",
    "#- Python installed on your system\n",
    "#- Basic knowledge of Python programming (if-else, lists, loops)\n",
    "#Code\n",
    "\n",
    "# Movie Recommendation System\n",

    "#Explanation\n",
    "#1. The program uses lists to store movies for different genres.\n",
    "#2. The user selects a genre by entering a number (1-4).\n",
    "#3. The program uses if-elif-else statements to check the user's choice and displays a list of movies from the chosen genre.\n",
    "#4. If the user enters an invalid choice, an error message is displayed.\n",
    "#Understanding the choice() Function\n",
    "#The `choice()` function in Python is part of the `random` module. It is used to randomly select one item from a list, tuple, or any other sequence.\n",
    "#Example Code:\n",
    "#import random\n",
    "\n",
    "# List of movies\n",
    "#ovies = [\"Mad Max\", \"John Wick\", \"The Dark Knight\", \"Gladiator\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Randomly pick one movie\n",
    "#selected_movie = random.choice(movies)\n",
    "#print(\"Your random movie is:\", selected_movie)\n"
