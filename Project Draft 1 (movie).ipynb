    "# Movie Recommendation System\n",
    "#This project is a simple Python-based Movie Recommendation System. It asks the user to select a preferred movie genre and then suggests movies from that genre. It uses fundamental Python concepts like lists and conditional statements (if-else-elif).\n",
    "# Requirements\n",
    "#- Python installed on your system\n",
    "#- Basic knowledge of Python programming (if-else, lists, loops)\n",
    "# ------> I will create a string-set of genres and use if-elif and also create a string value with movies of that specific genre.\n",
